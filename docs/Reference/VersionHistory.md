# Version History

Some resources (like Assets, Vendors, etc.) inside Environment supports Version History feature that allows tracking changes and modifications made to records over time. Version history provides trail of all updates, including field changes and user information.

Version History is not the same as Activity Logs. Activity logs are system-wide logs that track various actions and events across the entire Aexum platform, including user activities, system changes, and security-related events. Activity Logs provide a comprehensive overview of what is happening within the system for security and compliance purposes.

Goal of Version History is to provide history of changes and ability to compare and restore value data to previous versions.

Version History is created on each record update and is recording:

* Created On - date and time when change was made
* Created by - user who made the change
* Changed Fields - list of fields that were changed in this version (example Address1), including old and new value for each field

You can also export particular version history data.

In grid table view you can select multiple versions and compare versions on them.
