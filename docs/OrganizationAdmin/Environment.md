# Environment

Every Organization can have one or more Environments.
Each Environment represents a separate operational context within the Organization, such as development, testing, and production.

## Environment Create

Currently, environment creation is only possible through Aexum Support upon license activation.

## Environment Update

User can update environment name by clicking on edit icon next to environment name. User will be redirected to environment edit page in order to update name.

## Environment Delete

User can delete environment in root page by clicking on delete(bin) icon next to environment name. To delete environment, user needs to confirm exact name of environment.
User can also delete environment in environment home page with exact action as in root page, by clicking delete icon and confirming name of environment.

**Warning:** Deleting an environment is irreversible and will permanently remove all associated data, including users, assets, and configurations. Ensure you have backed up any critical information before proceeding with deletion.
