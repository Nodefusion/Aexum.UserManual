# Organization Users

Users page shows users grid with users in organization. User can filter users by user name.
When clicked on Display Name in grid, it redirects user to user edit page where display name, email and account status is shown.

Users are created automatically using backend integration with Nodefusion Account that is used for authentication and authorization purposes.

Once users are in Aexum Organization, they are also part of Aexum Environment(s) that belong to the Organization, where can be assigned to Assets, Teams, and Environment Permission Groups.
