# Organization

Using Aexum starts with creating and managing your organization. An organization represents your company or entity within the Aexum platform. Each organization has its own set of users and configuration.

Each organization have one or more Environments associated with it. Environments are used to separate different operational contexts, such as development, testing, and production.

## Organization Create

Currently, organization creation is only possible through Aexum Support upon license activation.

## Organization Update

User can update organization name by clicking on edit icon next to organization name. User will be redirected to organization edit page in order to update name.

## Organization Delete

User can delete organization in root page by clicking on delete(bin) icon next to organization name. To delete organization, user needs to confirm exact name of organization.
User can also delete organization in organization home page with exact action as in root page, by clicking delete icon and confirming name of organization.

**Warning:** Deleting an organization is irreversible and will permanently remove all associated data, including users, assets, and configurations. Ensure you have backed up any critical information before proceeding with deletion.
